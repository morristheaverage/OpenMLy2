*Notes on dataset*
Many students fail to complete assessments.
Around 10% of students are included twice as they sign up for multiple courses.
Some assessment scores are empty (nan as opposed to zero) - if not filled in default
to zero
In some modules there are no exam scores for any students

*Method*
create all potential data points including:
- info about student
- assessment scores
- vle interactions

**categorical data**
some features in studentInfo are categorical
various methods of converting these
1) highest_education and module_choice are converted into three single bit
features that encode the discrete category options
2) range data such as imd_band and age ranges are represented by a sensibly chosen
median value. e.g. imd_band of 40-50% becomes 45; age ranges (0-35, 35-55, 55+)
became (25, 45, 65)
3) region can be turned into 4 features showing it's normalised performance at
attaining each type of final_result

Various methods of deciding which features to keep and which to remove
